# VADER-Sentiment-Analyzer

Using the VADER algorithm found in text-analysis toolbox of Matlab we can classify whether the input sentence is positive, negative, neutral. 

In python we used the speech_recognition and pocketsphinx to get a audio input; convert it to text and then using the matlab VADER engine we use to 
analyse it polarity.
